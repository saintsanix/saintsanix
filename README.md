I decided to become a programmer in 2020. I started learning the Java programming language and I liked it. But it turned out that in order to become a developer, being able to write code in Java is not enough 😄 you need to know a lot of other technologies. And it turned out to be cool! 😎 Because in the IT sphere it is impossible to reach the ceiling, here you always have to learn and develop.

The stack of technologies that I have mastered at the moment (to a greater or lesser extent) :

●	Java
●	HTML, CSS
●	MySQL
●	JDBC, ORM Hibernate
●	Multithreading, ForkJoinPool
●	Redis, MongoDB
●	Docker
●	REST API
●	Spring Boot
●	Thymeleaf
