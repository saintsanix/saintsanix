👋 Hi, my name is Aleksandr. I am a backend developer.

I decided to become a programmer in 2020. I started learning the Java programming language and I liked it. But it turned out that in order to become a developer, being able to write code in Java is not enough 😄 you need to know a lot of other technologies. And it turned out to be cool! 😎 Because in the IT sphere it is impossible to reach the ceiling, here you always have to learn and develop.

The stack of technologies that I have mastered at the moment (to a greater or lesser extent) :

Java
HTML, CSS
MySQL
JDBC, ORM Hibernate
Multithreading, ForkJoinPool
Redis, MongoDB
Docker
REST API
Spring Boot
Thymeleaf
