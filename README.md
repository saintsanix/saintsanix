<h3 align="center">I am a backend developer from Russia</h3>


I decided to become a programmer in 2020. I started learning the Java programming language and I liked it. But it turned out that in order to become a developer, being able to write code in Java is not enough 😄 you need to know a lot of other technologies. And it turned out to be cool! 😎 Because in the IT sphere it is impossible to reach the ceiling, here you always have to learn and develop.

The stack of technologies that I have mastered at the moment (to a greater or lesser extent) :

<p>●	Java<br>
●	HTML, CSS<br>
●	MySQL<br>
●	JDBC, ORM Hibernate<br>
●	Multithreading, ForkJoinPool<br>
●	Redis, MongoDB<br>
●	Docker<br>
●	REST API<br>
●	Spring Boot<br>
●	Thymeleaf<br>
